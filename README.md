# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Final course project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course 

This project uses data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, available from UCI at this link: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The R script runanalysis.R reads the files, merges the test and training datasets into a single file, and provides descriptive variable and activity names. The final tidy dataset "datafinal" provides information on the mean and standard deviations only for each variable. 

The dataset "datafinal_mean" provides the mean for each variable by human subject and activity. 

The file "codebook.md" provides information on the data and variables.
